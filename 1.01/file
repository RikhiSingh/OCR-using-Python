OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Python Library works well on computer generated text but not on handwritten one. 

Though, there are other ML modules that work well though.

Workflow:

Changes based on type of document and also quality of that document but for most part it looks like

1. PIL (Pillow) = Used to open an Image

2. OpenCV = Change an Image (Manipulate the Image, like greyscale it, tune the other things or take bits out of it, extract a table out of the image)

3. Tessereact (PyTesseract) = OCR an Image (has about 14 parameters; over 100 languages supported)

For a computer an image is simple a grid of pixels, no text exists for it of course.

Tabula - a good library to extract tabular data
